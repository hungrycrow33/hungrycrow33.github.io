            <p class="title">2021 Redistricting Gerrymandering Analysis Project</p>
           
            <p class="text">During the final capstone project in CSE416, I designed and implemented a data visualization web application to analyze gerrymandering in 2021 Redistricting plans. Our team collaborated and discussed how to utilize population, demographic, and map data to determine whether a redistricting plan is biased. </p>
            <p class="text">As a front-end developer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visualized the data by considering the most appropriate charts to manage various data types, including demographic data, plan comparisons, and map-related data.</li>
                <li>Designed the UI/UX to ensure that users can easily gain a deep understanding of the data and draw insightful conclusions through their interactions. This process involved conducting research on similar websites and iterating through various design approaches. </li>
                <li>Used React, HTML, and CSS to create the application's interface and functionality that were previously discussed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="middletitle">1. Logo for Podcast "Samples.31c" </p>
            <p class="text">During the FLM303 course, I created a podcast that revolves around the concept of a post-apocalyptic story. The podcast centers on "the last radio station on Earth in the 31st century," delivering sounds from the society of the 21st century. As part of this project, I have designed the logo showcased below.</p>

         <p class="text"><b>Colors:</b> I utilized a "Retro style" color palette to evoke a sense of nostalgia and convey an atmosphere of the past, aiming to evoke a feeling of history and nostalgia.</p>
         <p class="text"><b>Design:</b>  To signify that it is an archive, I used a "zip" icon, symbolizing compression and storage. Also, the shape of a cassette tape to evoke a vintage aesthetic.</p>

        <p class="text">I developed a logo for a game development team called "Coco Eclipse." To align with the team name, I used a coconut shape as the foundation and added a crescent shape on top to represent the "eclipse" effect happening over the coconut. </p>
        <p class="text">For the color scheme, I opted for neon green and black to give a cyberpunk, arcade atmosphere that aligns with the type of games the team aims to develop. Additionally, I added a cute face resembling a coconut hole, which reflects the team's personality.</p>

        <p class="title">Typography Work</p>
        <p class="text">I also have deep interest in typography, and this is an example where I took the word 'stress' and designed it around its definition.</p>
        <p class="text"> To convey the idea of a stressful situation and the potential harm that can arise from excessive stress while working, I incorporated cut or gunshot wounds on a serif font. I chose serif to evoke a formal and societal tone. Additionally, I selected a bright green color to depict a venomous and intense scenario.</p>

Through deliberate design choices, such as using complementing colors and vibrant hues, I aimed to capture the mood and aesthetics of the characters and their setting, bringing their unique narratives to life.</p>
