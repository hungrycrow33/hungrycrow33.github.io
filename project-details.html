              <h4>What is Grounding?</h4>
              <p>
                Grounding is a powerful tool for people with PTSD, panic
                disorder, or anxiety.<br />
                When they're hit with flashbacks or panic attacks,
                <b>grounding helps them snap back to reality</b>. <br />It acts
                as both an emergency brake for the mind and an emotional anchor,
                pulling them back to the present. <br />
              </p>

              <h5>
                However, while grounding techniques are powerful mental health
                tools,
                <strong
                  >mastering them is challenging, demanding extensive and
                  consistent practice</strong
                >.
              </h5>
              <div class="vspacer-36">&nbsp;</div>

              <h4>Motivation for the project</h4>
              <p>
                The challenge of this effective but difficult-to-master
                technique isn't just the amount of practice required. My friends
                who use grounding also struggle to find
                <b>
                  safe, comfortable spaces or assistance to practice
                  effectively.
                </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                This realization inspired us to pursue groundbreaking research
                on the subject, aiming to contribute to the field in a
                meaningful way. After extensive brainstorming, we finally
                arrived at a promising solution:
              </p>
              <div class="vspacer-16">&nbsp;</div>
              <h5 class="w-70 text-center">
                What if we could use VR to create a safe, <br />personalized
                environment for grounding practice?
              </h5>

              <p class="mb-36">
                Grounding comes in three different types, each using unique
                forms of self-stimulation to help individuals regain control
                during distress or dissociation. One can choose the method that
                works best and feels most comfortable for them.

              <h4>Initial User Persona</h4>
              <p>
                Based on affinity diagramming and user research, I developed a
                single persona, as our interview group consisted exclusively of
                women in their twenties, representing a focused demographic.

                but new users don't have one. Should users create their shelter

              <p>
                Users need a safe space for grounding, but new users don't have

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a critical decision point in the design process. I
                needed to carefully structure the user journey to prevent users
                from abandoning the app midway through their experience.

                <li>
                  Con: Potential overwhelm for new users, creating a barrier to
                  entry

              <h4>Realizing My Mistake</h4>
              <p>
                I went back to reading the interviews, analysis, and persona.
                That's when I realized I had made a crucial mistake.
              </p>
              <div class="vspacer-16">&nbsp;</div>
              <h5 class="text-center w-70">
                <strong>
                  The initial persona was based solely on <b>demographics,</b>
                  <br />not on characteristics that would actually inform the
                  user flow and design decisions.
                </strong>

              <div class="vspacer-16">&nbsp;</div>

              <div class="vspacer-36">&nbsp;</div>
              <h4>Revised Personas</h4>
              <p>
                After much reflection, I decided to remake the personas based on
                <b>users' familiarity with grounding techniques</b>, recognizing
                that this skill varies greatly based on individual experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                This process was challenging, as it required me to reanalyze all
                the interview data from a new perspective. I carefully
                categorized the interview results into beginner and proficient
                users, which provided a more comprehensive understanding of user
                needs.
              </p>
              <h4>Beginner Users (e.g., "Kim Chobo"):</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Lack confidence in applying grounding techniques during crises
                </li>
                <li>Absence of readily available safe spaces for practice</li>
              </ul>
              <img

              />
              <h4>Experienced Users:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Limited opportunities to expand grounding technique repertoire
                </li>
                <li>
                  Need for more personalized, comforting virtual environments
                </li>
              </ul>
              <img
                src="./images/be_images/user_persona_advanced.png"

              <div class="vspacer-36">&nbsp;</div>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>
                The revised personas revealed that my primary focus should be on
                <strong>first-time users like "Kim Chobo"</strong>. Based on
                this, I developed the following solution:
              </p>

              <div class="vspacer-16">&nbsp;</div>
              <img src="./images/be_images/option-final.png" width="100%" />
              <div class="vspacer-16">&nbsp;</div>

              <p><strong>Key Insights</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add <b>starting space</b> for immediate grounding practice
                  (Nature, Indoor, ...)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Introduce <b>shelter creation during the tutorial</b>,
                  specifically in the soothing grounding section
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This approach lowers the entry barrier for beginner users while
                still offering personalization options that more experienced
                users desire.
