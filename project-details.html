              <h4>What is Grounding?</h4>
              <p>
                Grounding is a powerful tool for people with PTSD, panic
                disorder, or anxiety. When they're hit with flashbacks or panic
                attacks,
                <b>grounding helps them snap back to reality</b>. It acts as
                both an emergency brake for the mind and an emotional anchor,
                pulling them back to the present. <br />
              </p>

              <div class="vspacer-16">&nbsp;</div>
              <h5 class="text-center mb-4">
                Although grounding techniques are powerful mental health tools,
              </h5>
              <h5 class="text-center mt-0">
                mastering them is challenging,
                <b>demanding extensive and consistent practice</b>.
              </h5>
              <div class="vspacer-36">&nbsp;</div>

              <h4>Motivation for the project</h4>
              <p>
                The challenge of this effective but difficult-to-master
                technique isn't just the amount of practice required. My friends
                who use grounding also struggle to find
                <b>
                  safe, comfortable spaces or assistance to practice
                  effectively.
                </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                This realization inspired us to pursue groundbreaking research
                on the subject, aiming to contribute to the field in a
                meaningful way. After extensive brainstorming, we finally
                arrived at a promising solution:

              <div class="vspacer-16">&nbsp;</div>
              <h5 class="w-70 text-center">
                What if we could use VR to create a safe, personalized
                environment for grounding practice?

              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> Users need a safe space for grounding,
                but new users don't have one. Should users create their shelter
                before or after starting grounding exercises?
              </p>
              <h4>Options Considered:</h4>

                <li>
                  <strong>Create Shelter -> Start Grounding</strong>

                    <li>
                      Con: Potential overwhelm for new users, creating a barrier
                      to entry
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Start Grounding -> Create Shelter</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pro: Immediate access to grounding techniques</li>
                    <li>
                      Con: Might not cater to users primarily interested in
                      creating their space
                    </li>
                  </ul>

              </ol>
              <p>
                This was a crucial decision point. The chosen sequence needed to

              <h4>Realizing My Mistake</h4>
              <p>
                I went back to reading the interviews, analysis, and persona.
                That's when I realized I had made a crucial mistake. The initial
                persona was based solely on demographics, not on characteristics
                that would actually inform the user flow and design decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                After much reflection, I understood that I needed to focus on
                the users' familiarity with grounding techniques, as this skill
                varies greatly based on experience. This insight led me to
                recreate the personas, despite the additional time and effort
                required.
              </p>
              <h4>Refining the Approach</h4>
              <p>
                I decided to remake the personas based on proficiency with
                grounding techniques. This process was challenging, as it
                required me to re-analyze all the interview data from a new
                perspective. I carefully categorized the interview results into
                beginner and proficient users, providing a more nuanced
                understanding of user needs.
              </p>
              <h4>Revised Personas</h4>
              <h4>Beginner Users (e.g., "Kim Chobo"):</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Lack confidence in applying grounding techniques during crises
                </li>
                <li>Absence of readily available safe spaces for practice</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Experienced Users:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Limited opportunities to expand grounding technique repertoire
                </li>
                <li>
                  Need for more personalized, comforting virtual environments
                </li>
              </ul>
              <img

              />
              <h4>Key Insight and Solution</h4>
              <p>
                Our revised personas revealed that our primary focus should be
                on first-time users like "Kim Chobo". Based on this, we
                developed the following solution:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Introduce shelter creation during the tutorial, specifically
                  in the soothing grounding section
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provide a temporary starting space for immediate grounding
                  practice
                </li>
                <li>
                  Allow users to create their personalized shelter later in the
                  process
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This approach lowers the entry barrier for novice users while
                still offering personalization options that more experienced
                users desire.
